Description

Meditative Pomodoro is a web application that promotes healthy studying habits by incorporating the Pomodoro studying technique and healthy mental health activities. There is a drop down menu that allows for the user to choose the length they wish to study, which mental health exercises they prefer, and for how many rounds they wish to study. Once they study for their allotted time, they will either receive a recomendation to partake in meditation, a journal exercise, exercises, or self-care. 

The technology used in this project consisted of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Initially were using Python Flask instead of JavaScript but, given the time restraint, we found that connecting our front end and backend would be easier if we decided to use JavaScript instead. This did cause a bit of trouble as two of us on backend had to learn the language from scratch, and then find matching modules/functions that we had been using in Python. 

In the process of completing the project there were some troubles that we faced outside of choosing a language. Compared to the functions in Python that we could use for time, there wasn't an exact equivalent to the functions we were using before; thus, we had to use new one's we weren't as familiar with. This led to us discovering that said functions have limitations, which led into a shift of our projects is presented. Initially the plan was to have the project run a max of 3 times, a minimum of 1, and it would be up to the user to decide. In either case, the code would stop to prevent the user from overworking themselves. Sadly, we weren't able to implement this, but in its place we were able to tell the user how many rounds they have left. 

Going forward it is our goal to be able to prevent the user from going over the recommended rounds. It is also a goal to be able to shift the timers out for one another instead of having each timer side by side in order to run.
