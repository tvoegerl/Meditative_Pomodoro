# Meditative Pomodoro

Description

Meditative Pomodoro is a web applicaion that promotes healthy studying habits by incorporating the Pomodoro studying technique and healthy mental health activities. There is a drop down menue that allows for the user to chose the length they wish to study, which mental health exercises they prefer, and for how many rounds they wish to study. Once they study for their alloted time, they will either recieve a reccomendation to partake in meditation, a journal exercise, exercises, or self care. In order to create this website we initially tried to use Flask, HTML, and CSS but soon opted for swapping  Flask with JavaScript. This allowed for easier connection between our frontend and backend.

Instructions
1) Chose which activity you'd like to do to maintain/promote your mental health. Your options include Self Care, Meditation, Exercise Promts, or Journal Promts.
2) Chose how long you which to study for. An appropriate breake time will be assigned based on your selection.
3) Chose the amount of rounds you'd like to study.
4) Hit start, and you may begin to study.
5) Note: the Demo option that is available in the drop down menue for time is 1 min of studying and 30 seconds of rest time.
